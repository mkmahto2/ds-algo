# Data Structures and Algorithms

Python and C++ Implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms from the Coursera course, 

- [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/)
- [Data Structures]()
- [Graph Algorithms]()
- [Advanced Algorithms]()
- [Final- Genome Challenge]()


*W.I.P.*
(This repository work is under progress, these are my solution to assignments for the courses)

# 1. Algorithmic Toolbox 
The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies.
